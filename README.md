# OrdersEngine
Simple hire orders management engine that I would like to expand more into a full inventory and hire orders system. This is a personal pet project for our wedding hire business

# Road Map
 - inventory with pricing
 - when creating order choose from inventory, auto calc total price
 - send email reminders to user and client about payment outstanding, due by date approaching, etc.
 - user management
 - client management
 - options on user and global scale

# Changelog
- 0.1 Initial commit: orders retrieved, new order can be created, deposit paid action, total paid action
